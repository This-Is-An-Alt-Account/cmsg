# Complete Minecraft Server Guide
This is an open-source documentation project with the goal of creating an expansive guide which explains how to create Minecraft servers. The guide should be easy to read, easy to understand, and approachable for those of all skill and experience levels.

## Scope
- How to create a basic Minecraft server with the official software.
- The basics of Java as it partains to Minecraft servers (garbage collection, heap size, .jar files, etc).
- Computer networking knowledge relevant to hosting a server and basic troubleshooting (DHCP, NAT, firewall rules, etc).
- 

Though the name implies the guide is strictly about Minecraft servers, the guide should cover information that is relevant to the creation and upkeep of a server.
