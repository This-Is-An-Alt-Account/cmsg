## Goals of This Project
- Be easy to read and comprehend.

# Repository Overview
The repository is configured to deploy the guide with Material on MkDocs via GitHub Pages. 
## Branches
There are three primary branches for this repo: `main`, `dev`, and `gh-pages`.
### main
The main branch contains the latest version of the guide's contents. When changes are pushed to main, a GitHub action is triggered which builds the site with the contents of main. Main will and should always represent the latest release of the guide. It should never contain WIP sections that would break the cohesiveness of the guide.
### dev
The dev branch is very similar to main except it contains in-development changes or other changes that have not yet been "released" into main. All contributions are done on the devc branch and only after manual checks are these changes pulled into main. The dev branch also builds the site on push and it can be found on the cmsg/dev/ path of the site. A warning is shown so that accidental visitors know that it is not the release version.
### gh-pages
This branch contains the actual site and is updated when the site is built on a push to main or dev. It is never manually edited.
